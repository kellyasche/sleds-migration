# Largest changes to original dataset

* Removed all observations of students who graduated before 2008. This was due to the fact that the CTE information had a record for each class taken by a student. Therefore, if a student was in their senior year in 2006, we only have one year of their CTE records, not the full Sophmore - Senior years like all the others.
