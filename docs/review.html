<div id="section-research-question-overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Research question overview</h1>
<p>The primary question for which this project wants insight is the
following;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are some of the factors that play a role in whether an
individual decides to work in the same “area” as their high school at
time X?
<ul>
<li>Area here equals the following;
<ul>
<li>Same County</li>
<li>Same EDR</li>
<li>Same research region (EDR 6W, EDR 6E, or EDR 8)</li>
<li>In Minnesota.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time X here equals the following;
<ul>
<li>The year of graduating high school.</li>
<li>The year of graduating high school plus two years.</li>
<li>The year of graduating high school plus 7 years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The dataset being used contains individuals that have graduated from
a high school between 2007 and 2019 located in one of the three EDRs
being research - EDR 6W, EDR 6E, and EDR 8. There are 38,154 individuals
in the dataset. Each individual has the following independent variables
that will be modeled.</p>
<div id="section-the-dependent-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>The dependent variables</h2>
<p>To keep this simple, let’s just use the response to whether the
individual was working in the same county as their high school county
from which they graduated.</p>
<p>When speaking with the guidance committee overseeing the formulation
of this project, they did not want to equate “high school summer jobs”
as the same as “working in the same county”. To account for this
difference, a decision was made that “meaningful employment” equals
1,000 hours worked at an employer in a given year.</p>
<p>So, when taking this into consideration there are multiple responses
to this independent variable which are defined here;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No MN emp record:</strong> the individual does not have a MN
employment record because they either did not work for an employer at
all, or worked for an employer outside of Minnesota the year they
graduated high school.</li>
<li><strong>No meaningful emp:</strong> they year of high school
graduation the individual
<ul>
<li>has a MN employment record; but</li>
<li>the amount of hours worked didn’t qualify as meaningful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>No location match:</strong> the year of high school
graduation the individual
<ul>
<li>has a MN employment record; and</li>
<li>the amount of hours worked qualified as meaningful; but,</li>
<li>the meaningful employment was not located in the same county as the
individual’s high school.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Location match:</strong> the year of high school graduation
the individual
<ul>
<li>has a MN employment record; and</li>
<li>the amount of hours worked qualified as meaningful; and,</li>
<li>the meaningful employment was located in the same county as the
individual’s high school.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

institution</li>
<li>“Did not graduate” = the individual attended a post-secondary
institution but did not graduate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>highest.cred.level:</strong> factor - an identifier of the

<ul>
<li>Less than associate degree</li>

<ul>
<li>EDR 6W- Upper Minnesota Valley</li>
<li>EDR 6E- Southwest Central</li>
<li>EDR 8 - Southwest</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>avg.cte.intensity:</strong> The purpose of the CTE intensity
measure is to determine whether a strong presence of CTE programming and
participation impacts migration patterns. The thinking is that there
will be plenty of students that may not dive deep into CTE coursework,
but just seeing it in your school and constantly being reminded of all
the local opportunities and occupational needs in the local area might
impact how a student views employment opportunities for themselves in
the future.We needed to come up with a measure of what the CTE
“intensity” was for each school by each year. To do this, Eric Shwankl,
Education Consultant with the Southwest West Central Service
Cooperative, came up with an ingenious way to measure “CTE intensity”
using the z-score (also called standard score). The z-score calculates
how far a value is (in terms of standard deviation) from the average in
the population. In this case z-score is used to measure how far one
schools CTE student participation % is from the mean of the percentage
of all schools that year, and how far one schools CTE courses offered
per student % is from the percentage of all schools for that year. This
particular column takes the average z-score from all the school
instances for each individual.</li>
<li><strong>avg.unemp.rate:</strong> the three year average unemployment
rate during an individuals Sophmore, Junior and Senior years.</li>
<li><strong>wages.3year.avg:</strong> the average county median
household income of an individuals Sophomore, Junior and Senior
years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, there are 25 variables included in the primary model. 12 of
which are binomial responses, 5 are multinomial, and the remaining 8 are
numeric values.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="section-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<div id="section-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The primary issue is that we have a multinomial dependent variable -
an individual can have one of four values. However, these values are
also dependent on each other. For example, for someone to have
meaningful employment, they also have to have a MN employment record.
When running a multinomial logistic regression it assumes that each
response is separate from each other. In the previous example, it would
conduct analysis in which someone with meaningful employment doesn’t
have a MN employment record, which isn’t true.</p>
<p>Therefore, this dependent variable is three different dependent
variables. We need to group each response into either a 1 or 0 depending
on the dependent variable being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model 1
<ul>
<li>Dependent variable: binary - individual has a MN employment record
or not at Time X
<ul>
<li>No MN emp record = 0</li>
<li>No meaningful emp = 1</li>
<li>No location match = 1</li>
<li>Location match = 1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Independent variables
<ul>
<li>Time X = grad year: All independent variables except anything
related to post-secondary attendance.</li>
<li>Time X = grad year + 2 &amp; grad year +7: All independent
variables.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Model 2
<ul>
<li>Dependent variable: binary - individual has meaningful employment at
Time X
<ul>
<li>No MN emp record = removed from dataset</li>
<li>No meaningful emp = 0</li>
<li>No location match = 1</li>
<li>Location match = 1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Independent variables
<ul>
<li>Time X = grad year: All independent variables except anything
related to post-secondary institution</li>
<li>Time X = grad year +2 &amp; grad year +7: All independent
variables.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Model 3
<ul>
<li>Dependent variable: binary - individual has meaningful employment in
the same location as their high school area X at Time X
<ul>
<li>No MN emp record = removed from dataset</li>
<li>No meaningful emp = removed from dataset</li>
<li>No location match = 0</li>
<li>Location match = 1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Independent variables Time X = grad year: All independent variables
except anything related to post-secondary institution Time X = grad year
+2 &amp; grad year +7: All independent variables</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I’m removing some of the individuals from the dataset
as I step through each model. When analyzing the relationship between
the independent variables with whether an individual has meaningful
employment or not, I’m removing all individuals that didn’t even have a
MN employment record. So the model is being run with individuals that
HAD a MN employment record. I’m not sure if this is the correct strategy
or not. But we will give it a try.</p>
<p>So, in the end this is just a very simple logistic regression for
each dependent variable at each time X. The structure of the analysis
will look like this;</p>
<ul>
<li>Time X = grad year
<ul>
<li>Model 1 - Has a MN employment record or not</li>
<li>Model 2 - Has meaningful employment or not</li>
<li>Model 3 - Has meaningful employment in the same region X as their
high school
<ul>
<li>Region X = County</li>
<li>Region X = EDR</li>
<li>Region X = Any of the EDRs (EDR 6W, EDR 6E, EDR 8)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time X = grad year +2
<ul>
<li>Model 1 - Has a MN employment record or not</li>
<li>Model 2 - Has meaningful employment or not</li>
<li>Model 3 - Has meaningful employment in the same region X as their
high school
<ul>
<li>Region X = County</li>
<li>Region X = EDR</li>
<li>Region X = Any of the EDRs (EDR 6W, EDR 6E, EDR 8)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time X = grad year +7
<ul>
<li>Model 1 - Has a MN employment record or not</li>
<li>Model 2 - Has meaningful employment or not</li>
<li>Model 3 - Has meaningful employment in the same region X as their

<ul>
<li>Region X = County</li>
<li>Region X = EDR</li>
<li>Region X = Any of the EDRs (EDR 6W, EDR 6E, EDR 8)</li>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>The following analysis will include the following for each dependent
variable;</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary = the n individuals in the dataset, the number and percent
of individuals for each category.</li>
<li>Logistic regression summary: the estimate, standard error, z-value,
and p-value for each independent variable in the model</li>
<li>The model fit: essentially the predictive power of the model using
McFadden equation.</li>
<li>Variance Inflation Factor: A check to see if there is any
multi-collinearity issues among the independent variables in the
model.</li>
</ul>

<div id="section-time-x-grad-year" class="section level2">
<h2>Time X = grad year</h2>
<p>The following analysis uses time X as the year the individual
graduated high school. For example, if an individual graduated in 2009,
then the “has MN employment record” dependent variable is a binary (1 or
0) on whether that individual had a MN employment record recorded in
2009.</p>

<h3>Model 1 - has MN employment record</h3>
<p>The table below shows that there are 38,154 individuals in the
dataset to be modeled and nearly 78% of the individuals in the dataset
had a Minnesota employment record the same year they graduated high
school.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record;</p>
<ul>
<li>Homeless: .59</li>
<li>Graduated from a town/rural mix high school: .35</li>
<li>Took ACT: .32</li>
<li>increasing MCA - reading scores: .19</li>
<li>Qualified for free and reduced lunch: .16</li>
<li>Increasing number of CTE courses taken: .02</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis also indicates that the following variables help predict
that an individual does NOT have a MN employment record;</p>
<ul>
<li>Took ACT: -.51</li>
<li>Graduated from EDR 6W: -.42 compared to EDR 6E</li>
<li>Non-english spoken at home: -.42</li>
<li>Graduated from EDR 8: -.41 compared to EDR 6E</li>
<li>is Male: -.36</li>
<li>Limited english proficiency: -.34</li>
<li>Took zero CTE courses: -.28</li>
<li>Considered needing special ed: -.17</li>
<li>Took AP exam: -.13</li>
<li>Higher avg unemployment: -.07</li>
</ul>
<p>One piece that’s really interesting is how much the EDR location of
the high school makes a difference. EDR 6W and EDR 8 are closer to South
Dakota, which may indicate why the relationship might be so strong and
predictive. If students go to South Dakota to work, than they don’t have
a MN employment record.</p>

<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in one of the three edrs;</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from EDR 8 high school: .66 compared to EDR 6E</li>
<li>Graduated from EDR 6W high school: .25 compared to EDR 6E</li>

<p>The analysis also indicates that the following variables help predict
that an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful
employment but does NOT work in the same edr as their high school</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from a urban/town/rural mix high school: -.78 compared to

<h2>Time X = grad year +2</h2>
<p>The following analysis uses time X as the year the individual
graduated high school plus two years. For example, if an individual
graduated in 2009, then the “has MN employment record” dependent
variable is a binary (1 or 0) on whether that individual had a MN
employment record recorded in 2011.</p>

<h3>Model 1 - has MN employment record</h3>
<p>The table below shows that there are 31,998 individuals in the
dataset to be modeled and nearly 75% of the individuals in the dataset
had a Minnesota employment record two years after graduating high
school.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in one of the three EDRs two years after graduating high
school;</p>

<h2>Time X = grad year +7</h2>
<p>The following analysis uses time X as the year the individual
graduated high school plus seven years. For example, if an individual
graduated in 2009, then the “has MN employment record” dependent
variable is a binary (1 or 0) on whether that individual had a MN
employment record recorded in 2016.</p>

<h3>Model 1 - has MN employment record</h3>
<p>The table below shows that there are 16,730 individuals in the
dataset to be modeled and nearly 67% of the individuals in the dataset
had a Minnesota employment record two years after graduating high
school.</p>

<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in the same county as their high school seven years
after graduating;</p>

entirely rural</li>
<li>MCA - science increasing score: .19</li>
<li>Total CTE courses taken: .04</li>

<li>Earned master or higher: -1.58</li>
<li>Earned bachelors: -.63</li>
<li>Graduated from EDR 6W: -.58 compared to EDR 6E</li>

<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in the same edr as their high school seven years after
graduating;</p>

<li>MCA - science increasing score: .13</li>
<li>Total CTE courses taken: .04</li>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in one of the three EDRs seven years after
graduating;</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from an EDR 8 high school: .51 compared to EDR 6E</li>
<li>Graduated from an EDR 6W high school: .18 compared to EDR 6E</li>
<li>MCA - science increasing score: .11</li>
<li>Total CTE courses taken: .02</li>

<p>The analysis also indicates that the following variables help predict
that an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful

<h1>Analysis with year</h1>
<p>So far I have not included high school graduation year. I want to see
if including that makes any difference. I’m just going to use grad year
plus two since that would make the most sense. Many of the folks that
are plus 7 would not have many of the most recent years.</p>
<div id="section-time-x-grad-year-2-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Time X = grad year +2</h2>
<p>The following analysis uses time X as the year the individual
graduated high school plus two years. For example, if an individual
graduated in 2009, then the “has MN employment record” dependent
variable is a binary (1 or 0) on whether that individual had a MN
employment record recorded in 2011.</p>
<p>The summary below shows that the model fit is 4.2% with 18 of the
variables being significant at p-value &lt; .05. Graduation year does
not reach the p-value threshold.</p>

<p>Looking at the values for the variance inflation factor test shows
zero variables with a value above 5, the typical threshold. The
variables related to post-secondary are creeping high though. High
school graduation year also seems to creep quite high along with 3 year
average wages.</p>

<p>The analysis indicates that the following variables help predict that
an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful employment
and is employed in the same edr as their high school two years after
graduating high school;</p>

that an individual does have a MN employment record and meaningful
employment but does NOT work in the same EDR as their high school two
years after graduating;</p>
